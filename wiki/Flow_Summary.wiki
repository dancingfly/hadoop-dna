# Flow Summary

= Introduction =

==Layer3Flow==
 This summarizes network flow based on source IP and destination IP

 Usage)
{{{
 hadoop jar hadoop-dna.jar org.hadoop.dna.analyzer.Layer3Sum 2012-07-14-22-15
}}}

 Result looks like

|| Row key || src IP dst IP , ex) 14.6.1.34_8.8.8.8 ||
|| Data    || Bytes Sent, Bytes Receive, Packet Sent, Packet Receive ||

14.6.1.34.23_8.8.8.8   10445 3423 53 24
  
==Layer3Flow2==

This summarizes network flow based on monitoring IP
It is summation of multiple destination IPs.

 Usage)
{{{
 hadoop jar hadoop-dna.jar org.hadoop.dna.analyzer.Layer3Sum2 2012-07-14-22-15
}}}

 Result looks like

|| Row key || monitoring IP , ex) 14.6.1.34 ||
|| Data    || Bytes Sent, Bytes Receive, Packet Sent, Packet Receive ||

14.6.1.34   10445 3423 53 24

== Layer3Graph ==

Layer3Graph makes Digraph of flow, which is used for FlowRank algorithm.

Input Path:   /data/temp/_Input Parameter_

Output Path: /data/graph_out/_Input Parameter_

 Usage)
